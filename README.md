PROGRESS:
Beginning- Messing with SFML and getting familiar with the libraries. Very raw and basic movement/collisions. Programmer art
Basics- Need-to-have engines are built or being built. Testing fluid movements and collisions. Small sprite sheets
Early Implementation- Basic engines are finished and being redesigned engines, adding more functionality for a more modular layout. Larger sheets
Building- More advanced engines and collision in development, looking a lot more at optimization. Huge art dump.

DEVELOPMENT:
Currently doing working on a huge design change. I'm planning out a component-based design for better debugging
and stricter data communication.

IMPORTANT:
I attached some stuff to the email that has details and goals
Also check out SFML and it's documentation, a lot of it is intuitive
